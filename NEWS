Changes in version 0.90

- The default behavior of srlog2 has been changed to wait until its
  buffer has been completely sent before exiting instead of exiting

  behavior, set $EXITONEOF.

- Added a backoff to sending INIs to avoid flooding busy receivers.

- Improvements to handling corrupted buffers in srlog2.

- Fixed typo in use of $NOFILES.
