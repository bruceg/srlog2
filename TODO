- Protocol:

  - The authenticator is still computed directly from the shared secret.
    Better would be to hash first or use HMAC methods.

- srlog2:

  - Add option to set path to host key

  - Add backoff on INI timing

- srlog2d:

  - Break pointer from sender to connection

  - Periodically garbage collect inactive connections

  - sender & service names may not contain '/' or start with '.'

  - Look up senders and services in directories:

    - Store host key in SENDER/.TYPE.pub

    - Store per-service key in SENDER/SERVICE/.TYPE.pub

    - Look up key on INI

    - Don't preload/reload senders

  - Add more counters for error packets

- Add "type" name and "public" flag to load_key function

- Gradually migrate to protocol v2
  - Add all the features to the INI1/CID1 packets

- Switch to curve25519 http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html
