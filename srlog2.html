<h2>High-Level Goals</h2>

<ul>

<li>Reliable log delivery

<li>Messages must be recorded in order of delivery (per service)

<li>Low overhead 

<li>Reliability across sender crashes 

<li>Non-forgeable (authentication) 

<li>Non-sniffable (encryption) 

</ul>

<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<ol>

<li><h3>Lost message / receiver outage</h3>

<p>If a message is lost between the sender and the receiver, reasonable
effort must be made to retransmit that message.

<p>Solution: If the sender does not acknowledge a message within a brief
interval, write the message and all subsequent messages to a file, and
retry the first lost message until it is accepted. At that time, resend
all the subsequent messages and remove the file.

<li><h3>Lost ack / sender outage</h3>

<li><h3>Duplicated message</h3>

<p>If an ack is lost, the original message may be retransmitted. The
duplicate must not enter the logs.

<p>Solution: The sender will apply a sequence number to all
messages. The receiver will acknowledge and drop all authenticated
messages with a sequence number less than the one it expects to see
next.

<li><h3>Lost message during retransmit</h3>

<p>If a message is lost during retransmit, all messages between the lost
message and the current message must be retransmitted.

<li><h3>Lost ACK during retransmit</h3>

<li><h3>Sender crash</h3>

<li><h3>Forged message</h3>

<p>The system must prevent an attacker from adding a forged message to
the logs for any system.

<li><h3>Forged acknowledgement</h3>

<p>The system must prevent an attacker from forging an acknowledgement
for a message. While this may not appear to be a big deal, it may result
in lost messages in the worst case.

<li><h3>Intercepted message</h3>

<p>The system must prevent an attacker from discerning the contents of a
message.

<p>Solution: Encrypt messages. Blowfish? DES? Rijndael?

</ol>


<h2>Ideas / Optimizations</h2>

<ul>

<li>Reduce the number of times the buffer file is created and deleted by
temporarily storing lines into an internal linked list while waiting for
an ACK.

<li>Merge multiple messages into a single packet; merge multiple ACKs
into a single packet.

</ul>
